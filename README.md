# Comparison of Tools for the Verification of Cryptographic Protocols

This repository is about the final essay for the Computer Network Security master degree course I attended as a Bachelor student.

Three security protocol analysis tools will be compared: [Proverif](https://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/bblanche/proverif/), [Tamarin-prover](https://tamarin-prover.github.io/) and [Verifpal](https://verifpal.com/). All of these tools employ a symbolic model.
