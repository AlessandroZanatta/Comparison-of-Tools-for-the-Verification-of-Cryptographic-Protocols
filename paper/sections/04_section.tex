Tamarin
    Pros:
        - More expressive formulas for security properties
        - Sound and complete
        - Can prove observational equivalence
        - Possibility of manually guiding the proof when heuristics fail to do so automagically
        - Can model many algebraic properties of groups for DH key exchanges (comes with higher computational cost!)
        - Can model xor and elliptic curve operations
        - Supports user defined equational theories
        - More flexibility on post compromise properties using timepoints, but lemmas become more verbose
    Cons:
        - Probably harder to model
        - Slower (do benchmarks!!)


Proverif
    Pros:
        - Long history
        - Can prove observational equivalence
        - Supports user defined equational theories
    Cons:
        - Uses an old-style syntax
        - CANNOT model many algebraic properties of groups for DH key exchanges (only commutativity)


Verifpal
    Pros:
        - Very simple to use (both model specification and queries), while being expressive enough for most use cases
        - Possibility to translate to proverif/coq (even though its limited)
        - Very intuitive language
    Cons:
        - There may be queries that CANNOT be expressed (try finding a counterexample!)
        - CANNOT prove observational equivalence
        - It's very recent, still in beta
        - CANNOT model many algebraic properties of groups for DH key exchanges (only commutativity ???)
        - does NOT support user-defined equational theories
