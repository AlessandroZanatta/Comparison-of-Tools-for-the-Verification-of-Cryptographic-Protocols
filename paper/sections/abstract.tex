    Cryptographic protocols and algorithms are nowadays widely used to obtain a secure communication over an insecure network. Many common-use technologies have demanding security and privacy requirements. Correctness of protocols deployed for this applications has been proven to be an hard problem for designers. Automated tools can help the designer improve the reliability and security of protocols. There are many publicly available free tools, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. In this short paper we will compare three of them: Tamarin-prover, Proverif and Verifpal.
